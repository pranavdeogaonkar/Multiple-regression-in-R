# Multiple-regression-in-R
Research Question:
To predict the solar radiation level for four months (september-december 2016) at Hawaii islands. Do factors such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, DayLight duration and Wind Pressure influence the prediction of Solar radiation level?

This dataset is from Kaggle and is part of NASA hackathon.

In this Project, Multivariate linear regression is implemented in RStudio. Data preparation and transformation is carried out and a model is created in an iterative process to predict the solar radiation level. Linear regression assumptions are also validated against the model.
Do factors such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, DayLight duration and Wind Pressure act as significant predictors is validated.
